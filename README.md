Flappy Bird
This is a simple game made in Love2D, where you control a bird and try to fly through pipes. The game features randomly generated pipes with variable lengths and gaps for the bird to pass through. The game ends if the bird hits any of the pipes. The player's score is displayed on the screen.

## Getting Started
To run the game, you need to have Love2D installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Love2D from the official website (https://love2d.org/).

After installing Love2D, you can simply run the game by zipping the main.lua file and dragging the zip onto the Love2D icon.

## Game Controls
The player controls the bird by pressing the spacebar to make it jump.

## Game Mechanics
The game features two pipes that move towards the bird from the right side of the screen. The pipes have different lengths and are separated by a gap that the bird can fly through. The player earns points by flying through the gaps between the pipes. The game ends if the bird collides with any of the pipes.

## Contribution Guidelines
If you would like to contribute, feel free to do so! There is still a lot of work that can be done. Some things I'd like to add would be:

* a prettier score UI
* a highscore / current score feature
* saving highscore locally
* sprites for the bird / pipes
